Created Saturday 22 December 2018

Do some research, earn some funds. There aren't many reasonable contracts to choose from. -_-

===== Primary Objectives =====
[*] [[c:Test TD-12 Decoupler on a sub-orbital trajectory over Kerbin]]
[x] [[c:Science data from Space around Kerbin]]
[*] Recover [[a:Valentina]] Safely

===== Objectives =====
[*] Recover capscule
[*] Recover service module
[x] Recover goo cannister
[*] Recover thermal sensor
[*] Recover pressure sensor
[*] Land near KSC

===== Vehicles and Astronauts =====
* [[v:Grace 2T]]
	* [[a:Valentina]]

===== Outcome =====
SUCCESS! The decoupler test went off without a hitch. The mystery goo container exploded on touch down, so we didn't recover the data from space. The rest of the command module service bay assembly survived.
