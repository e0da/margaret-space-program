====== 0001-002-00-02 - Hoisted by My Own Part Clip ======
Created Saturday 22 December 2018

The [[v:Grace 2T]] performed admirably, but the goo canister exploded on touchdown, and so we failed to achieve one of the primary objectives of [[m:KRB-5]]: recover scientific data from space. Curse my hubris! I clipped the part through the bottom off the service bay so it'd look cooler. I'll fix it in the next iteration by attaching it to the bottom of the capsule instead.
