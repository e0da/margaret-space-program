Created Sunday 23 December 2018

Valentina guided the unconventional looking [[v:Grace 2T]] Mk4 to glorious success fulfilling all primary and secondary objectives of [[m:KRB-7]]. That's a big decoupler. The secret to success was actually including it in the ship design. RTFM >_<

===== Contracts Complete =====
* [[c:Test TD-25 Decoupler splashed down at Kerbin]]
* [[c:Haul RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster into flight above Kerbin]]
