Dammit. I placed the decoupler at the wrong height. The bottom node snapped to the capsule instead of the top node, so it was clipped and when I deployed it while splashed down I didn't get credit for it. That kinda sucks, but it's kinda cool. So we'll have to try this again in [[m:KRB-7]]. But we did manage to recover a bunch of science from space! Yeah! [[m:KRB-6]] is a partial success!
