Primary Objectives
------------------

* ☑ [c:Conduct a focused temperature survey below 16.8km of CQ-B8K](../../c/Conduct_a_focused_temperature_survey_below_16.8km_of_CQ-B8K.markdown)
* ☑ [c:Conduct a focused temperature survey below 16.6km of 1QFSG4](../../c/Conduct_a_focused_temperature_survey_below_16.6km_of_1QFSG4.markdown)
* ☑ Recover [a:Valentina](../../a/Valentina.markdown)


Secondary Objectives
--------------------

* ☑ Recover plane
* ☑ Conduct scientific experiments
* ☑ Land on KSC runway
* ☑ Recover experiments


Vehicles and Astronauts
-----------------------

* [v:Wayback:1](../../v/Wayback/1.markdown)
	* [a:Valentina](../../a/Valentina.markdown) - Commander and Pilot


Observations
------------
That was neat! I got so distracted watching the plane fly I missed the second temperature target twice, so we flew past it 3 times. Had to wave off first attempt at landing at KSC. Came in too hot. Second attempt was uneventful. The plane is amazing.

Budget
------

* Launch: -18
* Recovery: 18
* Contracts: 14 + 14 = 28
* Revenue: 28 + 18 = 46
* Profit: 46 - 18 = 28
