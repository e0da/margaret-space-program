Do some research, earn some funds. There aren't many reasonable contracts to choose from. -_-

Primary Objectives
------------------

* ☑ [c:Test TD-12 Decoupler on a sub-orbital trajectory over Kerbin](../../c/Test_TD-12_Decoupler_on_a_sub-orbital_trajectory_over_Kerbin.markdown)
* ☒ [c:Science data from Space around Kerbin](../../c/Science_data_from_Space_around_Kerbin.markdown)
* ☑ Recover [a:Valentina](../../a/Valentina.markdown) Safely


Objectives
----------

* ☑ Recover capscule
* ☑ Recover service module
* ☒ Recover goo cannister
* ☑ Recover thermal sensor
* ☑ Recover pressure sensor
* ☑ Land near KSC


Vehicles and Astronauts
-----------------------

* [v:Grace:2T](../../v/Grace/2T.markdown)
	* [a:Valentina](../../a/Valentina.markdown)


Outcome
-------
SUCCESS! The decoupler test went off without a hitch. The mystery goo container exploded on touch down, so we didn't recover the data from space. The rest of the command module service bay assembly survived.
