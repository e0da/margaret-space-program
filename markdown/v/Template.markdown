#### Issues

1. [m:KRB:5](../m/KRB/5.markdown): The goo canister exploded on touchdown. It was probably clipped too far down.


### Mk2

#### Updates


2. Attach goo canister to command module to protect it from impact on touchdown

#### Bugs

6. [m:KRB:6](../m/KRB/6.markdown): ~~The decoupler was placed such that the bottom node connected to service bay instead of the top node, so it couldn't successfully decouple.~~ I installed the wrong part.


### Mk3 DNF

#### Updates


7. [m:KRB:7](../m/KRB/7.markdown): Include decoupler
