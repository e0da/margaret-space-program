# Grace:3
Created Monday 24 December 2018

The Grace:3 flies us higher than we've ever flown and is our first rocket to feature radially attached engines and radial staging. It is also the first craft to feature a backup battery.

#### Issues

1. It's too long and too flexible. It wobbles on ascent. It chills right out once you drop the booster. Would benefit from longer fuel tank parts and struts.
