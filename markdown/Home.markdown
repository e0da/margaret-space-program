-----------------------

* Rewards are abbreviated as x-y-z (e.g. 3500-1-2) where x is funds, y is science, and z is reputation
* A DNF designation on a vehicle means it did not fly. Usually this means a flaw was discovered in the R&D phase.
* Single letter name spaces are used for organization and brevity.
	* a = astronaut, e.g. [a:Valentina](./a/Valentina.markdown)
	* c = contract, e.g. [c:Escape the atmosphere!](./c/Escape_the_atmosphere!.markdown)
	* l = log, e.g. [l:0001-002-04-37 - Well, This Is Awkward](./l/0001-002-04-37_-_Well,_This_Is_Awkward.markdown)
	* m = mission, e.g. [m:KRB-7](./m/KRB-7.markdown)
	* v = vehicle, e.g. [v:Grace 2T](./v/Grace_2T.markdown) Mk4. Note that the Mk4 is not part of the link. All revisions are on the same page.
