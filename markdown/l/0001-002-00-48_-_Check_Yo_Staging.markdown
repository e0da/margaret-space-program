# 0001-002-00-48 - Check Yo Staging
Created Saturday 22 December 2018

Dammit. I placed the decoupler at the wrong height. The bottom node snapped to the capsule instead of the top node, so it was clipped and when I deployed it while splashed down I didn't get credit for it. That kinda sucks, but it's kinda cool. So we'll have to try this again in [m:KRB:7](../m/KRB/7.markdown). But we did manage to recover a bunch of science from space! Yeah! [m:KRB:6](../m/KRB/6.markdown) is a partial success!
