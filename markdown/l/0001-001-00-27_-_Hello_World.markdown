Created Saturday 22 December 2018

Jebediah Kerman commanded the [v:Fido:0](../v/Fido/0.markdown) "rover" vehicle in its maiden "voyage" on [m:KRB:1](../m/KRB/1.markdown). Because Fido can't move, it just sat on the pad. Jebediah collected a crew report, goo canister reading, and EVA reports from the launch pad and the vehicle assembly building.
